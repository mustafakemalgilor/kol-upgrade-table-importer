# Knight online upgrade table importer

This utility is based on KOUpgradeEditor shared by TwoStars (https://github.com/twostars/KOUpgradeEditor), but working principle is fundamentally different than the based work. This utility automatically tries to generate upgrade table based on item*.tbl files. Hence this utility is named a `importer` not a `editor`.

This project is for educational purposes only.

Thanks for both jonny and @twostars for the initial work and inspiration.
